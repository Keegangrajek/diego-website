# diego-website
just a repo to log progression of website development and to help figure out issues/bugs

## Going to have multiple updates.
First update should be around April 1st (everything should be running and the website should be functional (I have 23 days as of today, 3/8/2022)
Will post update log under this after I have completed it, will be working on this website every day until completion.

## Update 3/8/2022

I am going to try and implement all the links and icons in the navbar as well as fix everything that needs to happen with the navbar on each page (I think I have 6, so far).
Also, I need to make sure that things are properly linked so I will ask diego to run through all of the links and let me know which ones I have missed or are having issues.
After this I will refine the buttons on the website to be squares instead of rounded on the edges.
I also want to add a hover feature to the navbar buttons that adds a square around it, so this matches the website styling. I also want this to apear during the selection of objects using the tab button (I might implement the selection in version 2).

## Plan after I have done this ^
- I will then add the functionality of the shop button on the navbar to just drop down when hovered over to include 2 links (prints, and originals).
This will also link to the page of "shop.html"
- After this I will start finishing up the about page, and then start doing the shop.

## Plan for shop
Some sort of flex-box grid design for each product. (Only applies to originals, also everything will be hard coded for now)
- Price (upon hover)
- Sold or nah
- link to other page with more details about how to purchase, as well as more images of the piece.
